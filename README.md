## Introduction

**MRIDC is a toolbox for applying AI methods on MR imaging. A collection of tools for data consistency and data quality
is provided for MRI data analysis. Primarily it focuses on the following tasks:**

### **Reconstruction**:
The following models are implemented for accelerated MRI reconstruction:

### **Quantitative Imaging**:
The following models are implemented for quantitative imaging:
1.[quantitative Cascades of Independently Recurrent Inference Machines (qCIRIM)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6560/ac6cc2),
2.[quantitative End-to-End Variational Network (qE2EVN)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-59713-9_7),
3.[quantitative Independently Recurrent Inference Machines (qIRIM)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07819),
4.[quantitative Recurrent Inference Machines (qRIM)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1361841518306078?via%3Dihub).

_Note: Currently only the above models are implemented. More models can be added by extending the reconstruction models
for quantitative imaging. If you wish to extend the toolbox, please open an issue._
